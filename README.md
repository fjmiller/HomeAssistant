# HomeAssistant
  A collection of home assistant configuration and automations from my set-up.


  # Configurations
* [Low Battery Notifications](/Battery_Sensor): Get notified in Lovelace or through the notification system when device battery levels drop below a threshold.
* [Entity Monitor](/Entity_Monitor): Get notified in Lovelace or through the notification system when an entity is unknown, unavailable or dead
* [Home Occupied](/HomeOccupied): Track whether your home is occupied or not including an override for guest presence.
* [Home Assistant Started](/HomeAssistant_Start): toggle an input boolean when Home Assistant starts.  Useful for triggering Node-Red Flows and checking to see if the system just started.
* [Virtual School Announcements](https://github.com/fjmiller/HomeAssistant/tree/master/Viritual_School_Schedule_Announcements) : Reads events in a Google Calendar and Announce them via Alexa for early warnings and on-times.  Currently used for keeping track of the Virtual School Schedule for my child and letting him know when he needs to be on Zoom!  Home Assistant helping with Covid!!
