# HomeAssistant
  A collection of home assistant configuration and automations from my set-up.


  # Configurations
* [Low Battery Notifications](/Battery_Sensor): Get notified in Lovelace or through the notification system when device battery levels drop below a threshold.
* [Entity Monitor](/Entity_Monitor): Get notified in Lovelace or through the notification system when an entity is unknown, unavailable or dead
* [Home Occupied](/HomeOccupied): Track whether your home is occupied or not including an override for guest presence.
* [Home Assistant Started](/HomeAssistant_Start): toggle an input boolean when Home Assistant starts.  Useful for triggering Node-Red Flows and checking to see if the system just started.


If you are looking for more automations I have Node-Red Flows on the project [HomeAssistant_NodeRed](https://github.com/fjmiller/HomeAssistant_NodeRed) including:
* [GE DoubleTab Switch Timer](https://github.com/fjmiller/HomeAssistant_NodeRed/tree/master/GE_DoubleTapSwitch_Timer)
* [Alexa Timer Notifications](https://github.com/fjmiller/HomeAssistant_NodeRed/tree/master/Alexa_Timer_Notification)
